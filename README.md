# python_challenge
Holds my Model 3 challenge files


Both of the main.py files include elements found on the internet and integrated into the code. Because they involved specifics with syntax and not unique code, it was not neccisary to cite these uses.
Tutors, AskBCS, and TA's were instramuental in helping me think through the PyBank code, specifically how to calculate and store the changes between one value and another during each iteration.
Google Bard played a big part in helping me with specific syntax uses and showing me ways to use different modules to process the data better. The Collections and Decimals modules were specifically used in these to help the code work better, the latter solving the floating-point errors I kept coming across when calculating the percentage of votes per candidate in the PyPoll part of the challenge.
    As well, Bard, generated the framework for the export functions I used at the end of each file. I modified the framework to work with my specific uses.
